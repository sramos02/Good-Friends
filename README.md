# Good-Friends
A aplication that recomed you possible good friends that match with your profile

The project has 3 states

Compare tweets liked and retweeted: Compare your liked and retweeted tweets with the other people, if 5/10 (not balanced) are the same or comes from the same accounts the program will recommend you this user.

Read and compare similar hashtags: The program look for similar themes or words

Real world language processing: The program will read all the (new) tweets and look for other users that write about it

For the moment the project is only a concept, its my first project in Python so it will take a while Thank you for the support, all help is welcome!
